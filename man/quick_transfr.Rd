\arguments{
\item{obs}{"transfR" object of the gauged catchments}

\item{sim}{"transfR" object of the ungauged catchments}

\item{velocity}{character string describing the method to estimate the streamflow velocity.
See \link{velocity} for the available options (\code{method} argument)}

\item{distance}{character string describing the method to compute the distance between catchments.
See \link{hdist} for the available options (\code{method} argument)}

\item{gres}{resolution of spatial discretisation (number of points by kmÂ²) for Ghosh
distance. See \link{hdist} for more details}

\item{weightO}{weight given to the distance between outlets if distance method is "combined".
See \link{hdist} for more details}

\item{weightC}{weight given to the distance between centroids if distance method is "combined".
See \link{hdist} for more details}

\item{power}{exponent applied in the inverse distance weighting strategy. See \link{weightr} for more details}

\item{ndonors}{maximum number of catchments to be used to simulate discharge of an ungauged
catchment. See \link{weightr} for more details}

\item{maxdist}{maximum distance between a gauged and an ungauged catchment to allow the net rainfall
to be transfered. This threshold is applied on the \code{mdist} distance matrix. If no units is provided,
\code{maxdist} is assumed to be in [m]. See \link{mixr} for more details}

\item{flexible_donor}{boolean indicating if the donor catchments can change during the simulation period
according to the availability of discharge observations. See \link{weightr} for more details}

\item{cv}{boolean indicating if cross validation evaluation should be done. If true, it will estimate
the net rainfall of every gauged catchments (\code{obs}) as if they were ungauged (leave-one-out evaluation)}

\item{save_donor}{boolean indicating if the net rainfall of each of the \code{ndonors} catchments
should be stored in the sim object for further analysis. If true, it is adding three new space-time attributes
in the \code{sim} object called "RnDonor", "Idonor" and "Wdonor" describing the net rainfall, the id and
the weight of the donor catchments respectively. See \link{mixr} for more details}

\item{warmup}{length of the warmup period. If no unit is provided, \code{warmup} is assumed to be in [days].
See \link{inversion} for more details}

\item{cooldown}{length of the period removed at the end of the simulation. If no unit is provided,
\code{cooldown} is assumed to be in [days]. See \link{inversion} for more details}

\item{dosplit}{boolean, if true the inversion is performed by
subperiods of length defined by \code{split}. See \link{inversion} for more details}

\item{split}{length the subperiods if dosplit is true. If no unit is provided, \code{split} is assumed to be
in [days]. See \link{inversion} for more details}

\item{parallel}{logical indicating if the computation should be parallelised}

\item{cores}{the number of cores to use for parallel execution if \code{parallel} is TRUE.
If not specified, the number of cores is set to the value of \code{parallel::detectCores()}}

\item{verbose}{boolean indicating if information messages should be written to the console}

\description{
Wrap up all the modelling steps into one function for a quick implementation of this R package.
}
\details{
The function applies sequentially the following functions: \link{velocity}, \link{uh},
\link{lagtime}, \link{rapriori}, \link{inversion}, \link{hdist}, \link{mixr} and \link{convolution}.
Please refer to the help of each of these functions and to \link{transfR} for a general description of the
modelling approach.
